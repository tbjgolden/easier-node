# easier-node

> Node.js, but with a modern API

Assumes Node 16+

This is:

- an abstraction layer over common Node built-in APIs
- strict about semantic versioning
- a zero-dependency 'lite' implementation of the most commonly installed npm packages

This is not:

- exhaustive over each built-in
- for browser packages
- a one-to-one name mapping from old API to new API
